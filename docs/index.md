# BMDS UI

BMDS UI is a user interface for running `pybmds`, a python package for dose-response modeling using the US EPA's Benchmark Dose Modeling Software ([BMDS](https://www.epa.gov/bmds)).  The user interface is a web application, and it is desgined for running as a web application (such as [BMDS Online](https://bmdsonline.epa.gov)) or a desktop model, which we call BMDS Desktop.
