Welcome to BMDS webserver's documentation!
==========================================
BMDS Server is a web application for conducting dose-response modeling using the US EPA's Benchmark Dose Modeling Software ([BMDS](https://www.epa.gov/bmds)). It utilizes the Python BMDS [package](https://pypi.org/project/bmds/) under the hood, which can be helpful for batch-executing analysis that do not require a user-interface.
